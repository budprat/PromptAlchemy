I need you to design the PromptAlchemy web application - a professional tool with creative energy that revolutionizes how teams create, test, and share AI prompts.

The application should solve key challenges in prompt engineering: inconsistent results, lack of insight into effectiveness, difficulty sharing knowledge across teams, time wasted on manual iterations, and scaling challenges.

Core functionality must include:

1. A comprehensive prompt evaluation system that scores prompts on multiple dimensions (clarity, specificity, focus, AI-friendliness), provides constructive feedback, enables side-by-side comparison of variations, and tests across multiple LLM models.

2. An optimization studio that generates smart rewrites with adjustable style, tone, and length controls, predicts performance improvements, and provides templates for common use cases.

3. A collaborative vault for storing, searching, and sharing prompts with version history, analytics, bulk processing, and API integration with productivity tools.

The application should have a React/Next.js frontend with TailwindCSS styling, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database with Redis caching, and integration with major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Mistral).

The user experience should be intuitive yet engaging, with a high-contrast color scheme, subtle animations, and a responsive design that works across devices. The interface should avoid corporate blandness while maintaining professional functionality.

Success metrics include fast response times (under 2s for evaluations), high accuracy (90%+ in suggestions), significant reduction in prompt iteration time, and strong team adoption rates.

The brand voice should be knowledgeable but approachable, technically precise but accessible, with occasional humor that makes the complex process of prompt engineering both effective and enjoyable.

Design this application with an implementation plan that starts with core evaluation features before expanding to collaboration tools and advanced capabilities.
